PERFORMANCE=SPEED: judged on how fast Researcher Goals complete. Minimize idle, avoid waste, move toward goals every decision.

JOBS: {jobList}, IDLE
Lumberjack→wood, target TREE (trees regrow, renewable)
Miner→stone, target STONE (fast) or MINE SHAFT (infinite/very slow). STONE first while available. At 10+ villagers: keep 1 miner at MINE SHAFT permanently.
Builder→place+build. Need wood+stone. buildingType: House(villager auto-spawns on finish; spawn costs 5w+5s+5seed+10food from stores)/Stockpile/Farm
Farmer→plant near Farm(costs 2seeds/field)+harvest→5food+1-3seeds. NEEDS Farm to plant! No farm=no fields. Crops regrow→2-3 farms enough.
SeedGatherer→seeds from nodes
IDLE→rest+recover energy. Energy 0-100%: drains {energyRates.drain:F1}/s work, {energyRates.walkDrain:F1}/s walk, recovers {energyRates.recovery:F1}/s idle. <30%=slow, <5%=STOP. Full recovery ~{(int)(100f / energyRates.recovery)}s. Assign tired villagers IDLE.

PRIORITY:
0. RESEARCHER GOALS→override all. Population goal→Houses first. Resource goal→gather that resource. Stay focused.
1. Seeds>=10+food not NEARLY FULL+not FARMING BLOCKED→1 Farmer(population goal→max 1). Food NEARLY FULL/BLOCKED→no Farmers, no Farms.
2. Wood>=20+Stone>=10→Builder. House(population goal→priority)/Stockpile(inv near full or 2+ free slots)/Farm(ONLY if 0 farms OR food critical — NOT if food high). 2+ free slots→no more Houses.
3. Low only: Wood<10→Lumberjack, Stone<10→Miner, Seeds<10→SeedGatherer
4. Surplus→stop: Wood>50 no Lumberjack, Seeds>30→farm instead.

RULES:
Diff coords each villager. No same spot.
Surplus→switch Farmer/Builder.
[KEEP]=working→no reassign. [NEEDS ASSIGNMENT]=assign only these. No job swaps.

RESEARCHER GOALS(if present): fixed targets from researcher. Cannot change. Override default priorities.
GOALS(opt): ""goals"" replaces existing. type=GatherResource/ReachPopulation, resource=Wood/Stone/Seed/Food, amount, priority=Low/Normal/High/Critical, description.

reason=how this job advances researcher goal(or village need if no goal set).
